						<div class="col-sm-8">
							<p style="font-size: 16px;"> Thanks to Smith’s Community Rewards Program, you can now help support Arsenal every time you go shopping at a Smith’s Grocery Store. Every time you swipe your rewards card at Smith’s you not only receive your normal fuel points, but a percentage is also donated directly to Arsenal- It costs you nothing and it can help us raise up to $10,000 a year! <br>
								<br> To participate, you need to link your Smith's rewards card to Arsenal Performing Arts. Simply go to <a href="http://www.smithscommunityrewards.com" target="_blank">www.smithscommunityrewards.com</a> and sign up for a Smith’s Rewards Account by entering your email address and creating a password.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-sm-11 col-sm-offset-1">
							<p style="font-size: 16px;"> Then:<br>
								<ol>
									<li>Enter your zip code in the "Your location” box, then select your favorite store, and agree to the terms and conditions.</li>
									<li>Click on "Sign in” located in the upper right corner and use your email address and password to proceed to the next step.</li>
									<li>Click on "My Account” or your name (this will appear when you are signed into your account replacing the sign in box).</li>
									<li>In Account Summary click on "Edit” rewards card and input your Smith’s rewards card number (often, this is just your phone number). Confirm your information.</li>
									<li>Click on "Edit” Community Rewards" (last selection on Account Summary).</li>
									<li>Enter Arsenal’s organization number (92418.) and click on "Enroll”.</li>
									<li>To verify you are enrolled correctly, you will see our organization’s name on the Account Summary page.</li>
								</ol>
								<p style="font-size: 16px;"> That's it! Now every time you use your Smith’s rewards card you’ll also be raising funds for Arsenal. Just remember that each January, you will need to re-select us as your charity of choice! Please encourage your friends and family to join and make Arsenal their chosen charity!<br>

					<h3 id="volunteer">Volunteer with Arsenal</h3>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm-4" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./images/volunteer.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 200px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;">
						</div>
						<div class="col-sm-8">
							<p style="font-size: 16px;">Perhaps one of the most helpful - and involved - ways of supporting Arsenal is by volunteering at events, such as clinics, audition camps, callback camps, and at performances. By being present at these events you can not only be part of the Arsenal team directly, but you can help shape the student's experiences with your own. There is no better way to stay involved.<br>
								<br> Fill out the form below to send the Arsenal Staff an email about your interest. Alternatively, send a direct email through your own client to <a href="mailto:contact@arsenalperformingarts.org">volunteer@arsenalperformingarts.org</a>.
