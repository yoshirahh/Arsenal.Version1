    <h1>History</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>In the fall of 2015 while working to fulfill his degree requirements in arts management, J. Spenser Lotz drafted a complete plan for starting a Drum and Bugle Corps in the State of New Mexico. At the urging of his teachers he began to share the plan with others and was immediately met with a rush of support from the community, including music educators, local businesses, and fellow students. Joining forces with fellow alumni of DCI world-class corps as well as several local music educators, the group that would come to be known as the Arsenal Initiative began laying out a strategy for creating a new drum corps, and in the spring of 2016 Arsenal Performing Arts was incorporated in the state of New Mexico. <br>
      <br>
      When it came to naming the new organization there were many things to take into account. We wanted a name that was not only fitting for a Drum and Bugle Corps, but also a name that played into the history of our State while simultaneously emulating our vision for the future. The name Arsenal was chosen because it is our belief that students here in New Mexico are more than capable of high levels of excellence and achievement, and that they merely lack the tools they need to be successful. Our goal with Arsenal is to serve as a stockpile of resources for young people to grow as performers, leaders, and above all else, as people. We cannot provide the determination or energy for them to be successful, but we can provide the instruments and the teachers needed to harness that energy. <br>
      <br>
      Moving forward, we aim to proceed with great care being taken to maintain our organizationâ€™s stability, both financially and administratively. Following a strategy based on that of other new corps in the region, Arsenal Performing Arts aims to begin our first season by fielding a DCI SoundSport team for the 2017 season in order to test the waters and begin growing our organization locally and organically before attempting more ambitious goals. <br>
      <br>
      Upon completion of our first season the Arsenal Staff plan to evaluate how best to proceed, with the current sentiment in favor of working to evolve our Drum Corps from a simple SoundSport team into a DCI sanctioned Open Class corps as early as 2018. We also hope field an Independent Winterguard and host a number of clinics and competitive events in and around the city of Albuquerque. As we move forward we hope to continuously expand our programs to not only increase the areas of instruction but also to make them available to as many students as possible. <br>
