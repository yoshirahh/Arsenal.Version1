      <h1>Arsenal Drum and Bugle Corps</h1>
      <h3>Brief History</h3>
      <p>In the Spring of 2016 a group of music educators and arts advocates began a dialogue involving the creation of a competitive drum and bugle corps in the state of New Mexico. As time passed this dialogue gradually grew into a more solid movement which was to become known as the Arsenal Initiative. Under the leadership of project director J. Spenser Lotz an instructional staff and a board of directors were gradually assembled, paving the way for Arsenal Performing Arts to incorporate just as the 2016 summer tour was beginning. Acknowledging the need for caution in order to provide financial security for the new organization, the decision was made to wait until the 2017 to field a corps. Following a series of clinics in the fall, Arsenal plans to field a SoundSport team and perform in the 2017 DCI World Championship Tour, with plans to become Open Class as early as 2018.</p>
      <h3>Membership</h3>
      <p>If you are a student under 21 who would like the opportunity to be a part of the first DCI sanctioned unit out of New Mexico, we invite you to audition for the inaugural season of the Arsenal. For this first season we will be looking for members to fill approximately 35 brass and 15 battery percussion positions with our corps, and although we eventually plan to evolve into full Open Class Corps, as SoundSport team we will not be fielding a front ensemble or a colorguard. We recommend that anyone interested in marching Drum Corps, either with Arsenal or elsewhere, attend our clinics or audition camp.</p>
      <h3>Fall Clinics/Auditions</h3>
      <p>Currently, Arsenal is planning on holding a series of clinics, with the first one being held in July at La Cueva High School and the second to be held on October 8th, again at La Cueva (register for both <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#registerModal">here</a>). These clinics will serve as open house sessions for the corps and will lead up to our auditions in mid-December. All prospective members are encouraged to attend the clinics as clinic attendees will receive audition materials before they are released publicly on our website. Additionally, attending the clinics will give prospective members the chance to work with our staff and become associated with our technique before the auditions. Following the Audition Camp, we will have a callback Camp in January where we will award contracts for the 2017 season. </p>
      <h3>Spring Rehearsals/Camps</h3>
      <p>If offered a position with Arsenal, members will be asked to attend monthly camps leading up to a week or more of evening rehearsals immediately before our first show. We are still working on the specifics for these camps, but we aim to have all dates solidified by the fall clinic in order to provide a schedule so that members can be aware of the time commitment in full before they audition.</p>
      <h3>Tour</h3>
      <p>Our tour for the first season will be relatively short, consisting of a community performance, a recorded SoundSport Evaluation, and a trip to the Southwestern Championship in San Antonio, Texas, to take part in the SoundSport exhibition.</p>
      <h3>Tuition</h3>
      <p>If accepted as a performing member of Arsenal, students will be expected to pay what is commonly referred to as tour fees. It is our goal to keep these as low as possible for our first season, and while we can’t give you an exact amount yet, we are aiming at keeping these fees within the ballpark of 500 dollars. These dues cover the cost of everything associated with the summer experience, including the entrance fees for competitions, transportation and hotel costs for the Southwestern Championship and the uniforms for our first season, which members will keep following the completion of tour. A minimum monthly payment schedule will be required from every member accepted into the corps, and more details concerning tuition will be made available as we get closer to auditions. <br/>
