    In this email you will find a list of things that you will need for the clinic, a schedule for the day, and also an attached book of exercises for your chosen section. Please arrive to the clinic before 10:00 for registration so that we can get you a name tag and make sure that you have paid the camp fee. You may pay the camp fee during this time, but please note there will be an additional $5 convenience fee.</p>

  <h4>Required Materials:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Exercise packet: please print the packet and place it in a three-ring binder.</li>
    <li>Water bottle: a 2 liter water bottle should suffice, as we will be spending most of the day inside.</li>
    <li>A sack lunch or money for off-campus lunch (we will not be providing food at the clinic).</li>
    <li>A small backpack for your things.</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>
  <h4>Brass:</h4>
  Brass musicians will be expected to provide their own instruments- if you cannot do so please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@arsenalperformingarts.org" style="color: gold;text-decoration: none;">contact@arsenalperformingarts.org</a> as soon as possible so that we can see if we can get one for you.<br>
  <br>
  Please prepare all exercises in the packet ahead of time.  Additional brass music will be coming out soon - we are waiting on licensing for our brass encore, which will be used during auditions and our 2017 season. As soon as the licensing has been resolved, you will receive an updated packet with that information.
  <p></p>
  <p>
  <h4>Battery:</h4>
  Percussionists will be provided with sticks and drums, however,  all battery applicants should bring drum pads as their might not be enough drums for everyone to be playing at all times.<br>
  <br>
  Please prepare all exercises in the packet ahead of time. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:contact@arsenalperformingarts.org" style="color: gold;text-decoration: none;">contact@arsenalperformingarts.org</a>. There is additional material that will be added to the packet closer to the clinic date, so please prepare the exercises early so you have time to learn the new material.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Thank you, and see you soon!<br>
